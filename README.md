We have created an Area Calculator program which worksin C language. It provides you a pathway to calculate area of (n+9) shapes. Ranging from n-sided regular polygon to numerous shapes, we have a one-stop solution for calculating the area of various known shapes which are common in our day-to-day to life.

Here is how we use the code -

First of all we chosse the type of shape of which we have to calculate the area.
Refer to the following table and enter the desired number corresponding to the desired shape - 
1. N-SIDED REGULAR POLYGONS
2. CIRCLE 
3. SCALENE TRIANGLE 
4. ISOSCELES TRIANGLE 
5. RECTANGLE 
6. RHOMBUS 
7. TRAPEZIUM 
8. PARALLELOGRAM 
9. ELLIPSE 
10. KITE

After that, we now enter the dimensions which are needed for a particular shape. For example, for n-sided regular shaped polygon, we need to enter the number of sides and the side length. 
Make sure that you enter the valid dimension, else the area will not be calculated.

Copy push codes to the VSCode and run it on the terminal.
